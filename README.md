Being an avid music & entertainment tech-lover, I wanted to create a little something of my own to get a better understanding of how the apps I use and love every day actually work. 

Avri-fi is a simple music app with my top five favorite tracks that gets me motivated to slay the day. The UI is inspired by the Spotify and Apple mobile music streaming interfaces. 

For this project, I took it back to basics to solidify my knowledge of Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS/SCSS. A sprinkle of jQuery is also used to toggle on/off the player controls so you can see the backing video.

## Features I'd Like to Add

- Artist name & image displayed in background image view when controls are hidden
- Spotify API integration

## Last Thing

If you spot any bugs or have any suggestions to further improve the app, please let me know 🙏🏾 .  I am always looking for ways to learn and be better than I was the day before.

Please note I do not own the music and it is only used for educational purposes.
